# integrity-scanning Specification (delta)

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Content-addressed move/rename reconciliation

A scan SHALL reconcile moved/renamed files before it routes alerts, stamps proofs, or finalizes the
run. After the missing-sweep, a file newly classified `missing` whose stored SHA-256 **and** size
match **exactly one** file newly classified `added` in the same scan — where that content key is
shared by no other `missing` or `added` file in the run — SHALL be treated as a single moved file
rather than an independent deletion plus addition. Reconciliation SHALL preserve the original file's
identity: one surviving `files` row SHALL carry the new `relpath` with status `ok` while retaining
its `first_seen`, `sha256`, and OpenTimestamps proof (`ots_path`, `ots_state`, `ots_stamped_at`). A
reconciled move SHALL emit a single informational `moved` event recording the old and new paths,
SHALL NOT raise a `missing` or `added` event, SHALL NOT be counted as missing or added on the run,
and SHALL increment the run's `moved` count. Reconciliation SHALL be conservative: empty
(zero-byte) files, and any content key matching more than one candidate on either side, SHALL NOT be
reconciled and SHALL retain the existing `missing` + `added` behavior (logged for visibility).
Reconciliation SHALL rewrite only the index — never the corpus bytes — and SHALL NOT re-queue the
moved file for OTS stamping.

#### Scenario: A 1:1 move is reconciled to a single event

- **WHEN** a tracked file is moved/renamed to a previously-unseen path within the same corpus, its
  content unchanged, and no other file in the run shares that content
- **THEN** the scan SHALL produce one `moved` event (old → new path) and no `missing` or `added`
  event, and a single surviving `files` row SHALL hold the new `relpath` with status `ok`

#### Scenario: Moved file keeps its proof and is not re-stamped

- **WHEN** an already-stamped file in a `perfile` corpus is reconciled as a move
- **THEN** the surviving row SHALL retain its `ots_path`/`ots_state`/`ots_stamped_at`, and the scan
  SHALL NOT mark it `pending` or stamp a new proof for it

#### Scenario: Ambiguous content does not reconcile

- **WHEN** a `missing` file's content (sha256 + size) matches more than one `added` file, or is a
  zero-byte file
- **THEN** the scan SHALL NOT reconcile it and SHALL retain the `missing` + `added` classification,
  logging the fallback

#### Scenario: A real deletion is unaffected

- **WHEN** a tracked file is deleted and no `added` file in the run matches its content
- **THEN** the scan SHALL still classify it `missing` and write a `missing` event

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Scan classifies files with fast-path hashing

A scan SHALL walk a corpus root (honoring its exclude globs), diff the filesystem against the
`files` table by relative path, and classify each file as `added`, `modified`, `missing`, `ok`,
or `restored`. To avoid re-hashing unchanged data at scale, the scan SHALL compare size and mtime
first and SHALL compute the SHA-256 only when size/mtime differ or no prior hash exists. SHA-256
SHALL be computed by streaming the file in chunks (never loading it wholly into memory). Files
classified `missing` and `added` within a single scan SHALL then be subject to move/rename
reconciliation (see "Content-addressed move/rename reconciliation") before alerts are routed and the
run is finalized.

#### Scenario: New file is added

- **WHEN** a scan finds a file under the root with no matching `files` row
- **THEN** a `files` row SHALL be created with status `new`, its size/mtime/sha256 recorded, and
  an `added` event SHALL be written

#### Scenario: Unchanged file is not re-hashed

- **WHEN** a tracked file's size and mtime equal the stored values
- **THEN** the scan SHALL mark it `ok` and update `last_checked` without recomputing its SHA-256

#### Scenario: Modified content is detected

- **WHEN** a tracked file's bytes change so its SHA-256 differs from the stored hash
- **THEN** the scan SHALL record the new hash and (in worm mode) set status `modified` and write
  a `modified` event

#### Scenario: mtime moved but content identical

- **WHEN** a tracked file's mtime changes but its recomputed SHA-256 matches the stored hash
- **THEN** the scan SHALL keep status `ok`, refresh the stored mtime, and SHALL NOT write a
  `modified` event

#### Scenario: Missing file is detected

- **WHEN** a tracked file is absent from the filesystem during a scan
- **THEN** the scan SHALL set its status `missing` and write a `missing` event

#### Scenario: Restored file

- **WHEN** a file previously recorded `missing` reappears during a scan
- **THEN** the scan SHALL set its status back to `ok` and write a `restored` event

#### Scenario: A move is not reported as missing-plus-added

- **WHEN** a tracked file is moved/renamed to a new path within the corpus with unchanged content
- **THEN** the scan SHALL NOT report it as a `missing` file plus an `added` file, but SHALL
  reconcile it into a single moved file per the reconciliation requirement
